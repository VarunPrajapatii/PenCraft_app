## THE STACK

I'll be building a full stack blog website in the following technologies: 
### Frontend
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture.
### Backend
- Cloudflare Workers: Serverless execution environment ensuring high performance and low latency.
### Validation
- Zod: TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
### Language
- TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that enhances JavaScript with static type checking.
### ORM
- Prisma: Next-generation ORM for type-safe database querying and management.
### Database
- PostgreSQL: Robust, high-performance, open-source relational database.
### Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Secure method for transmitting information between client and server.

This stack provides a modern, scalable, and maintainable solution for building a full-stack blog website. Each component has been chosen to ensure high performance, security, and developer productivity.
